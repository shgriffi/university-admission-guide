# Transcript Preparation Guide for Homeschoolers

**For**: Homeschool Students (Class of [YEAR])
**Last Updated**: February 14, 2026

---

## Introduction

Your homeschool transcript is the single most important document in your college application. It's your academic record - a comprehensive summary of all coursework, grades, and achievements from 9th through 12th grade. Unlike traditional students whose schools create transcripts automatically, you and your parent will create this document together.

The good news: All eight of your target universities accept parent-created transcripts with no special requirements. This guide will show you exactly what to include, how to format it, and how to make your transcript look professional and credible.

---

## What a Homeschool Transcript Must Include

Every college transcript - whether from a traditional school or homeschool - must include these core elements:

### 1. Student Information (Header)

**Required**:
- Full legal name (as it appears on official documents)
- Date of birth
- Home address
- Contact phone number
- Email address (professional email recommended)

**Optional but Recommended**:
- Student ID number (if you create one for your homeschool)
- Social Security Number (only if specifically requested by university - usually not needed)

**Example**:
```
[Student Full Name]
Date of Birth: June 15, 2009
Address: 123 Main Street, Raleigh, NC 27601
Phone: (919) 555-1234
Email: connor.griffin@email.com
```

### 2. School Information

**Required**:
- Homeschool name (can be family name + "Homeschool" or "Academy")
- School address (typically your home address)
- School administrator/counselor name and signature (typically parent)
- Dates of operation (years homeschool was in session)

**Example**:
```
[Your Homeschool Name]
123 Main Street, Raleigh, NC 27601
School Administrator: [Parent Name] (parent/counselor)
Years in Operation: 2023-2027
```

**Note**: You do NOT need to be registered with an accredited organization or umbrella school. Your parent-operated homeschool is sufficient for all your target universities.

### 3. Grading Scale

Universities need to understand what your grades mean. Include a clear grading scale.

**Standard Percentage Scale** (Recommended):
```
Grading Scale (Percentage-Based):
A: 90-100%
B: 80-89%
C: 70-79%
D: 60-69%
F: Below 60%
```

**Alternative Letter Grade Scale**:
```
Grading Scale (4.0 Scale):
A: 4.0 (Excellent)
B: 3.0 (Good)
C: 2.0 (Satisfactory)
D: 1.0 (Passing)
F: 0.0 (Failing)
```

**Weighted Scale** (If using weighted GPA):
```
Weighted Grading Scale:
AP/Honors A: 5.0
AP/Honors B: 4.0
AP/Honors C: 3.0
Regular A: 4.0
Regular B: 3.0
Regular C: 2.0
```

**Note**: Choose ONE grading scale and use it consistently for all courses. Be honest and realistic - colleges expect variation in grades, not all As.

### 4. Courses by Year

List every course taken in 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, organized by academic year.

**For Each Course, Include**:
- Course title (use standard naming when possible)
- Grade received (letter grade or percentage)
- Credit value (typically 0.5 credit per semester, 1.0 credit per year-long course)
- Level designation (Regular, Honors, AP, Dual Enrollment)

**Example Format**:
```
GRADE 9 (2023-2024)
English 9                    A      1.0 credit
Algebra I                    B+     1.0 credit
Biology                      A      1.0 credit
World History                A-     1.0 credit
Spanish I                    B      1.0 credit
Physical Education           A      0.5 credit
Art I                        A      0.5 credit

GRADE 10 (2024-2025)
English 10 (Honors)          A      1.0 credit
Geometry                     B+     1.0 credit
Chemistry                    A-     1.0 credit
AP World History             B+     1.0 credit
Spanish II                   B      1.0 credit
Health                       A      0.5 credit
Music Appreciation           A      0.5 credit
```

### 5. GPA Calculation

**Unweighted GPA** (all courses counted equally):
- Calculate on 4.0 scale: A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, F = 0.0
- Add up all grade points, divide by total number of courses
- Example: (4.0 + 3.3 + 4.0 + 3.7 + 3.0) / 5 courses = 3.60 GPA

**Weighted GPA** (AP/Honors courses receive extra weight):
- AP/Honors: A = 5.0, B = 4.0, C = 3.0
- Regular: A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0
- Add up all weighted grade points, divide by total number of courses
- Example: (5.0 + 4.3 + 4.0 + 5.0 + 3.0) / 5 courses = 4.26 weighted GPA

**Which GPA to Report**:
- Report BOTH unweighted and weighted if you have AP/Honors courses
- Clearly label which is which
- Test-optional thresholds: Most NC schools use 2.8+ weighted for test-optional

**Example**:
```
Cumulative GPA (9th-11th Grade):
Unweighted GPA: 3.65 / 4.0
Weighted GPA: 4.18 / 5.0
Class Rank: Not applicable (homeschooled)
```

### 6. Credit Summary

**Total Credits Earned** (by subject area):
```
Credit Summary (9th-12th Grade):
English: 4.0 credits
Mathematics: 4.0 credits
Science: 4.0 credits
Social Studies: 4.0 credits
Foreign Language: 3.0 credits
Arts: 1.0 credit
Physical Education/Health: 1.0 credit
Electives: 3.0 credits
TOTAL CREDITS: 24.0 credits
```

**Minimum Credits for Graduation**: Most states require 20-24 credits for high school graduation. Verify NC requirements.

### 7. Standardized Testing (Optional but Recommended)

Including test scores on transcript provides third-party validation.

**Example**:
```
Standardized Testing:
PSAT/NMSQT (October 2025): 1280 (650 Math, 630 Reading/Writing)
SAT (March 2026): 1420 (720 Math, 700 Reading/Writing)
ACT (April 2026): 32 Composite
AP World History (May 2025): Score 4
AP Calculus AB (May 2026): Score 5
```

**Note**: This is optional. You can also self-report scores in college applications without including them on transcript.

### 8. Honors and Awards (Optional)

**Example**:
```
Academic Honors:
- National Merit Commended Student (2025)
- Presidential Volunteer Service Award (2024)
- North Carolina Homeschool Science Fair, 1st Place (2025)
```

### 9. Extracurricular Activities (Optional)

**Example**:
```
Extracurricular Activities:
- Robotics Club (2023-2026): Team Captain
- Community Volunteer, Habitat for Humanity (2024-2026): 200+ hours
- Youth Orchestra, Violin (2023-2027)
```

**Note**: Activities can also be listed separately in college applications. Including on transcript is optional.

### 10. Parent/Administrator Signature

**Required**:
- Signature line for parent serving as school administrator/counselor
- Date signed
- Title (e.g., "School Administrator," "Homeschool Director," "Counselor")

**Example**:
```
I certify that this transcript is a true and accurate record of [Student Name]'s academic coursework and grades.

---

## GPA Calculation Methods

### Unweighted vs. Weighted GPA

**Unweighted GPA** (All courses counted equally):
- **Scale**: 4.0 maximum
- **Calculation**: A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, F = 0.0
- **Best For**: Students without many AP/Honors courses
- **Advantage**: Simple, straightforward, no inflation

**Weighted GPA** (AP/Honors receive extra credit):
- **Scale**: 5.0 maximum
- **Calculation**:
  - AP/Honors: A = 5.0, B = 4.0, C = 3.0
  - Regular: A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0
- **Best For**: Students taking rigorous AP/Honors coursework
- **Advantage**: Rewards challenging courses, qualifies for test-optional

**Example Universities' Test-Optional Thresholds**:
- UNC Chapel Hill: 2.8+ **weighted** or B+ average
- NC State: 2.8+ **weighted** on 4.0 scale
- Duke: Test-optional (no GPA threshold specified)

**Recommendation**: If you have ANY AP or Honors courses, calculate and report both weighted and unweighted GPA. Many NC schools use weighted GPA for test-optional qualification.

### How to Calculate GPA: Step-by-Step

**Step 1**: Assign grade points to each course
- Use your chosen scale (4.0 or 5.0)
- Convert letter grades to numbers
  - Example: A = 4.0, A- = 3.7, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7, C+ = 2.3, C = 2.0

**Step 2**: Add up all grade points

**Step 3**: Divide by total number of courses

**Example**:
```
English 9: A = 4.0
Algebra I: B+ = 3.3
Biology: A- = 3.7
World History: A = 4.0
Spanish I: B = 3.0

Total grade points: 4.0 + 3.3 + 3.7 + 4.0 + 3.0 = 18.0
Number of courses: 5
GPA: 18.0 / 5 = 3.60
```

**For Weighted GPA** (if courses are Honors/AP):
```
English 9 (Regular): A = 4.0
Algebra I (Regular): B+ = 3.3
Biology (Honors): A- = 4.7  [3.7 + 1.0 bonus]
World History (Regular): A = 4.0
Spanish I (Regular): B = 3.0

Total weighted points: 4.0 + 3.3 + 4.7 + 4.0 + 3.0 = 19.0
Number of courses: 5
Weighted GPA: 19.0 / 5 = 3.80
```

### Common GPA Mistakes to Avoid

**Mistake 1: Inflating Grades**
- Problem: Giving all As when work doesn't merit it
- Why It Hurts: Test scores/AP exams will contradict grades, making transcript less credible
- Solution: Be honest and realistic; variety in grades is expected and normal

**Mistake 2: Inconsistent Grading Scale**
- Problem: Using different scales for different years
- Why It Hurts: Confuses admissions officers, makes GPA unclear
- Solution: Choose one scale and use consistently for all four years

**Mistake 3: Not Weighting Appropriately**
- Problem: Calling every course "Honors" to inflate GPA
- Why It Hurts: Admissions officers can tell when rigor doesn't match designation
- Solution: Only designate courses as Honors/AP if they truly are college-prep or college-level

**Mistake 4: Forgetting to Update**
- Problem: Not updating transcript each semester/year
- Why It Hurts: Scrambling senior year to recreate four years of work
- Solution: Update transcript at end of each semester or school year

## Course Descriptions and Syllabi Guidance

### When Course Descriptions Are Needed

**You Need Course Descriptions When**:
- Course title is unique or non-standard (e.g., "Exploring the American Dream through Literature")
- Course is self-designed or uses unconventional curriculum
- University specifically requests descriptions (check each school's requirements)
- Providing context helps explain rigor or depth

**You Don't Need Course Descriptions When**:
- Course has standard title (e.g., "Algebra II," "US History," "Biology")
- Course used well-known curriculum (e.g., "Algebra II - Saxon Math")
- Universities don't require them (most target schools in this example don't)

### What to Include in Course Descriptions

**For Each Course**:
1. **Course Title and Level**: "AP English Language and Composition (Advanced Placement)"
2. **Grade Level**: "11th Grade, 2025-2026"
3. **Credits**: "1.0 credit (full-year course)"
4. **Brief Description**: 2-4 sentences summarizing course content and skills
5. **Curriculum/Textbooks Used**: List main resources
6. **Key Topics Covered**: Bullet points of major units or themes
7. **Assessments**: How student was evaluated (tests, essays, projects, etc.)

**Example Course Description**:
```
AP ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND COMPOSITION
Grade Level: 11th Grade (2025-2026)
Credits: 1.0 credit
Level: Advanced Placement

Description:
This college-level course focused on rhetorical analysis, argument construction, and advanced composition skills. Students analyzed non-fiction texts from various time periods and disciplines, examining how authors use rhetorical strategies to achieve their purposes. The course emphasized critical reading, analytical writing, and synthesis of multiple sources.

Curriculum Used:
- The Language of Composition (Bedford/St. Martin's)
- 50 Essays: A Portable Anthology (Bedford/St. Martin's)
- AP English Language and Composition Course Description (College Board)

Key Topics Covered:
- Rhetorical analysis (ethos, pathos, logos, tone, diction, syntax)
- Argument construction and persuasive writing
- Synthesis of multiple sources
- AP-style essay writing (rhetorical analysis, argument, synthesis)
- Close reading and annotation strategies
- Research and citation (MLA format)

Assessments:
- Weekly rhetorical analysis essays
- Quarterly in-class timed writings (AP-style)
- Research-based argument paper (8-10 pages)
- AP-style multiple-choice practice tests
- AP exam in May 2026

Grade Earned: A (95%)
```

### Syllabi Guidance

**When Syllabi Are Needed**:
- Rarely required by universities (check individual school requirements)
- Some highly selective schools may request syllabi for unique courses
- Can be included as supplemental material if it strengthens application

**What a Syllabus Includes**:
- Course objectives and learning goals
- Week-by-week or unit-by-unit outline of topics
- Required textbooks and materials
- Assignment types and grading breakdown
- Any major projects or assessments

**Note**: For your eight target universities, course descriptions are generally NOT required unless courses have non-standard titles. Duke, UNC Chapel Hill, and NC State all note that descriptions are "optional" or "recommended only for unique courses."

---

## Grading Scales and Documentation

### Choosing Your Grading Scale

**Option 1: Percentage-Based (90-80-70-60)**
- A: 90-100%, B: 80-89%, C: 70-79%, D: 60-69%, F: Below 60%
- Advantages: Clear, objective, familiar to colleges
- Best for: Courses with quantifiable assessments (tests, quizzes, homework)

**Option 2: Letter Grade (A-B-C-D-F)**
- Assign letter grades based on overall performance
- Convert to 4.0 scale: A = 4.0, B = 3.0, C = 2.0, D = 1.0, F = 0.0
- Advantages: Simple, flexible for varied assessment types
- Best for: Courses with subjective assessment (writing, art, discussion-based)

**Option 3: Plus/Minus System**
- A+ (97-100), A (93-96), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), etc.
- Converts to: A+ = 4.0, A = 4.0, A- = 3.7, B+ = 3.3, B = 3.0, B- = 2.7
- Advantages: More nuanced, shows fine distinctions
- Best for: Parents comfortable with detailed grading

**Recommendation**: Use percentage-based grading (90-80-70-60). It's objective, clear, and aligns with most traditional schools.

### Documenting Your Grading Scale

**On Transcript**: Include a "Grading Scale" section that defines exactly what each grade means.

**Example**:
```
GRADING SCALE (Percentage-Based):
A:  90-100%  (4.0)
B:  80-89%   (3.0)
C:  70-79%   (2.0)
D:  60-69%   (1.0)
F:  Below 60% (0.0)

Weighted Scale for AP/Honors Courses:
AP/Honors A: 5.0
AP/Honors B: 4.0
AP/Honors C: 3.0
Regular A: 4.0
Regular B: 3.0
Regular C: 2.0
```

**In Course Descriptions** (if providing them): Note the specific percentage or letter grade earned.

### Grade Documentation and Record-Keeping

**What to Keep**:
- Assignment grades, test scores, quiz results
- Project evaluations and rubrics
- Essays with feedback and grades
- Lab reports, worksheets, problem sets
- Attendance records
- Evidence of completed work (digital portfolios, notebooks, etc.)

**Why Documentation Matters**:
- Supports the grades on your transcript
- Provides evidence if university questions your grades
- Helps you accurately calculate final grades for each course
- Creates accountability and credibility

**How to Organize**:
- Digital folder for each course (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- Physical binder for each subject year
- Spreadsheet tracking assignment grades and calculating course grade
- Save final exams, major essays, and significant projects

**Note**: While universities rarely request this documentation, having it available shows your transcript is based on actual coursework, not arbitrary grades.

---

## Parent Signature Considerations

### Who Signs the Transcript?

**Your parent signs as**:
- "School Administrator"
- "Homeschool Director"
- "Counselor"
- "Headmaster" (if you prefer formal title)

**All acceptable to universities**. Choose one title and use consistently.

### What the Signature Certifies

Your parent's signature certifies that:
- The transcript is a true and accurate record of coursework completed
- Grades reflect student's actual performance
- Credits assigned are appropriate for work completed
- Information is complete and honest

**Example Signature Section**:
```
CERTIFICATION

I certify that this transcript is a true and accurate record of [Student Full Name]'s academic coursework, grades, and credits earned during high school (grades 9-12). The information presented here is complete and honest to the best of my knowledge.

_____________________________________    ________________
[Parent Name], School Administrator      Date
[Your Homeschool Name]
Raleigh, North Carolina
```

### Parent as Administrator vs. Parent as Teacher

**Dual Role is Normal and Accepted**:
- Your parent is BOTH the school administrator (creates transcript, serves as counselor) AND the teacher (assigns grades)
- This is standard for homeschooling and accepted by all your target universities
- No university requires a third-party administrator to sign transcript

**If You Want Additional Credibility**:
- Have some courses taught by outside instructors (tutors, dual enrollment professors, online accredited courses)
- Include those instructor names on transcript for those specific courses
- Example: "AP Calculus AB - taught by Dr. John Smith, Wake Technical Community College"

## Common Transcript Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Incomplete Course Information
**Problem**: Missing courses, grades, or credits
**Fix**: Double-check that EVERY course from 9th-12th grade is listed with complete information

### Mistake 2: Inconsistent Grading Scale
**Problem**: Using different scales for different years or not defining scale clearly
**Fix**: Choose ONE grading scale and use it for all four years; clearly document it on transcript

### Mistake 3: Unclear GPA Calculation
**Problem**: Not showing how GPA was calculated or mixing weighted/unweighted without labeling
**Fix**: Show both weighted and unweighted if applicable; label clearly; explain weighting system

### Mistake 4: Unrealistic Grades
**Problem**: All As with no variation, or grades that don't match test scores/AP exam scores
**Fix**: Be honest and realistic; variety in grades is normal and expected

### Mistake 5: Missing Parent Signature
**Problem**: Forgetting to sign and date transcript
**Fix**: Always include signature, printed name, title, and date

### Mistake 6: Non-Professional Appearance
**Problem**: Handwritten transcript, inconsistent formatting, spelling errors
**Fix**: Type transcript in clean, professional format; proofread carefully; use consistent fonts and spacing

### Mistake 7: Including Too Much Information
**Problem**: Listing every assignment, quiz, and homework grade on transcript
**Fix**: Transcript lists courses and final grades only; save detailed grade records separately for documentation

### Mistake 8: Not Updating Regularly
**Problem**: Trying to recreate four years of coursework from memory senior year
**Fix**: Update transcript at end of each semester or year; keep ongoing records
