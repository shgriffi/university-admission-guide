## Test Score Requirements

### Policy
- **Test-Optional**: Yes, but with conditions
- **Weighted GPA 2.8+ (on 4.0 scale)**: Test scores not required
- **B+ Average (no 4.0 scale GPA)**: Test scores not required

### Score Requirements When Required
If weighted GPA is below 2.8, test scores are required:
- **ACT Minimum**: 17+
- **SAT Minimum**: 930+

### Test Score Details
- **Middle Range Context**: Most successful applicants submit scores well above the minimum thresholds
- **Superscore Policy**: Test scores considered in holistic admissions process
- **Self-Reporting**: Scores may be submitted through application platforms
- **Source**: [UNC Chapel Hill Undergraduate Admissions](https://admissions.unc.edu/)

**VERIFICATION NOTES**: UNC Chapel Hill implements a conditional test-optional policy. Applicants with strong GPAs (weighted 2.8+ or B+ average) are not required to submit scores. Applicants with lower GPAs should submit scores (ACT 17+, SAT 930+) to strengthen their applications.

## Academic Requirements

### GPA
- **No Minimum GPA**: UNC Chapel Hill does not publish a strict minimum GPA requirement
- **Competitive Context**: Most successful applicants maintain grades well above a B+ average
- **Strong Academic Coursework**: Emphasis on core academic coursework (English, math, science, social studies, foreign language)
- **Weighted GPA Assessment**: Weighted GPA of 2.8+ on 4.0 scale makes test scores optional
- **Source**: [UNC Chapel Hill - What We Look For](https://catalog.unc.edu/admissions/undergraduate/)

**VERIFICATION NOTES**: While no minimum GPA is published, admitted students typically demonstrate very strong grades in core academic subjects. The conditional test-optional policy (test-optional if GPA 2.8+) suggests competitive applicants should maintain high GPAs.

## North Carolina Residency

### In-State Advantages
- **Acceptance Rate (In-State)**: Approximately 42%
- **Acceptance Rate (Out-of-State)**: Approximately 10%
- **Enrollment Cap**: Maximum 18% of class from outside North Carolina
- **Preference**: Significant preference given to North Carolina residents
- **Source**: [UNC Chapel Hill Undergraduate Admissions](https://admissions.unc.edu/)

**CRITICAL INFORMATION**: UNC Chapel Hill is a public North Carolina university with a strong commitment to in-state enrollment. The 18% out-of-state cap and significant difference in acceptance rates (42% in-state vs. 10% out-of-state) reflect this institutional priority. Out-of-state applicants face substantially more competitive admissions.

## Homeschool-Friendly Rating

- **Rating**: Exceptionally Friendly
- **Rationale**: UNC Chapel Hill explicitly welcomes homeschool applicants with NO additional requirements beyond standard application materials. The university evaluates homeschoolers through the same holistic admissions process as traditional school applicants. This is one of the most homeschool-friendly policies among selective universities. The only caveat is the out-of-state enrollment cap (18% maximum), which may impact non-resident homeschoolers' acceptance rates.

## Key Takeaways for Connor

1. **Conditional Test-Optional**: UNC Chapel Hill allows test-optional submission if Connor maintains a weighted GPA of 2.8+ on a 4.0 scale or demonstrates a B+ average. If below this threshold, ACT 17+ or SAT 930+ should be submitted.

2. **Strong Academic Profile Needed**: Most successful applicants maintain grades well above a B+ average with strong core academic coursework (English, math, science, social studies, foreign language).

3. **Exceptionally Homeschool-Friendly**: UNC Chapel Hill explicitly welcomes homeschool applicants with zero additional requirements. Connor's homeschool transcript and documentation will be evaluated identically to traditional school transcripts through standard admissions materials.

4. **Early Action Advantages**: Connor should strongly consider Early Action deadline (October 15):
   - Earlier decision notification (by December 20 for NC residents)
   - Consideration for merit-based academic scholarships
   - Eligibility for Honors Carolina program
   - Potential assurance of admission to select professional programs
   - Non-binding commitment (can still compare options)

5. **In-State Advantage**: If Connor is a North Carolina resident, acceptance probability is approximately 42%. If out-of-state, acceptance rate drops to approximately 10% due to the 18% out-of-state enrollment cap.

6. **Application Timeline**:
   - Early Action (Recommended): Submit by October 15, 2025
   - Regular Decision: Submit by January 15, 2026
   - Final Enrollment Commitment: By May 1, 2026

7. **Application Strategy**: Connor should submit comprehensive homeschool transcript documentation, strong letters of recommendation, and compelling essays. If GPA is strong (2.8+ weighted), test scores are optional; otherwise, prepare ACT/SAT scores above the minimum thresholds.
