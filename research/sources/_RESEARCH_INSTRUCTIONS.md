# Research Instructions for University Requirements

**Purpose**: This directory contains research templates for gathering admissions information for Connor's 8 target universities.

**CRITICAL**: All information in these templates must be filled in by accessing reliable sources. DO NOT guess or make up information.

## How to Use These Templates

1. **Start with the university's official website** - Each template lists the official URLs
2. **Fill in current 2026-2027 information** - Deadlines and policies change yearly
3. **Document the date you accessed** - Mark "Research Date" and "Last Verified"
4. **Save URLs to specific pages** - If a page has the exact requirement, save that URL
5. **Clearly attribute non-official sources** - If information comes from a reputable source other than the official website, note this explicitly
6. **Mark sections as "NOT AVAILABLE"** if information cannot be found

## Research Timeline

**Best Time to Research**:
- **August-September 2025**: Most universities publish 2026-2027 application information
- **Early verification recommended**: Some universities update deadlines mid-cycle

**Where deadlines haven't been published yet**:
- Use 2025-2026 dates as a reference with notation: "2025-2026 date, 2026-2027 not yet published"
- Check back monthly for updates

## Homeschool-Specific Research

Pay special attention to:
- Transcript format requirements
- Third-party validation requirements (AP, dual enrollment, etc.)
- Letters of recommendation policies (can parents write one?)
- Additional testing requirements for homeschoolers
- Course description requirements

Many universities have dedicated homeschool contacts - ask to speak with them if information isn't clear.
