## Academic Requirements

### GPA Requirements

#### Minimum GPA
- **California Residents**: 3.0 unweighted minimum
- **Out-of-State Applicants**: 3.4 unweighted minimum
- **Note**: These are absolute minimum thresholds; competitive applicants significantly exceed these numbers

#### Typical Admitted Student Profile

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Average Admitted GPA** | 3.93 |
| **Unweighted GPA 4.0+** | 56% of Class of 2028 |
| **Median Weighted GPA** | 4.58 |
| **Middle 50% Weighted Range** | 4.40 - 4.73 |

#### GPA Weighting Policy
- **For In-State Students**: Weighted GPA includes both honors and AP/IB courses with approved bonus points
- **For Out-of-State Students**: Only AP and IB courses qualify for GPA weighting; standard honors courses do not receive bonus points
- **UC-Approved Courses**: Only UC-approved honors, AP, and IB courses contribute to weighted GPA calculations

### Standardized Test Scores

#### Test-Blind Policy
- **UCLA is test-blind**: Standardized test scores (SAT/ACT) are NOT considered in admissions decisions
- **UC System Policy**: This is a University of California system-wide policy that applies to all UC schools
- **Scholarship Exception**: Test scores may NOT be used for scholarship eligibility determinations
- **Post-Enrollment Use**: Scores may be submitted after enrollment for course placement purposes only

#### Implications
- Applicants do NOT need to submit SAT or ACT scores
- Score submission will not affect admissions chances (positive or negative)
- Time and money spent on test preparation does not factor into UCLA's admissions process
