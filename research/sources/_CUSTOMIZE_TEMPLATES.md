# Template Customization Required

**IMPORTANT**: The university research template files (duke-requirements.md, ucla-requirements.md, etc.) have been created by copying the nc-state-requirements.md template.

## Before Using These Templates

**Each university template file MUST be customized** with that university's specific information:

1. **Update the university name** in the title
2. **Replace the URLs** with that university's official websites
3. **Update university-specific details**:
   - Federal school codes (for FAFSA)
   - University classification (public vs private)
   - In-state vs out-of-state status for Connor (only NC schools are in-state)
   - Any university-specific program names or requirements

## Files That Need Customization

- `duke-requirements.md` → Update for Duke University
- `ucla-requirements.md` → Update for UCLA
- `app-state-requirements.md` → Update for Appalachian State University
- `nc-at-requirements.md` → Update for North Carolina A&T University
- `georgia-tech-requirements.md` → Update for Georgia Institute of Technology
- `unc-charlotte-requirements.md` → Update for UNC Charlotte
- `unc-chapel-hill-requirements.md` → Update for UNC Chapel Hill
