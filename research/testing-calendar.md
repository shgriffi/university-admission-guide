## Critical ACT Test Dates for Connor's Timeline

### Last Test for Early Action/Early Decision
- **Last ACT Date**: October 2026
- **Registration Deadline**: ~September 2026 (3-4 weeks before, midnight Central Time)
- **Why Critical**: If Connor switches to ACT after September SAT attempt, October is the final ACT test before EA/ED deadlines. Scores release in November (best case), which is tight but may arrive before some ED deadlines.
- **Score Risk**: ACT can take up to 8 weeks for score release; October test may NOT have scores back before November 1-15 ED deadlines
- **Connor's Action**:
  - If considering SAT-to-ACT switch, must decide by early August 2026
  - Register for October ACT by late August 2026 if switching
  - Earlier September ACT test is safer for EA/ED deadline compliance

### Last Test for Regular Decision
- **Last ACT Date**: December 2026
- **Registration Deadline**: ~November 2026 (3-4 weeks before, midnight Central Time)
- **Why Critical**: If Connor switches to ACT, December is the final test before RD deadlines. January score release is possible, which meets most January 1-15 RD deadlines.
- **Score Risk**: ACT can take up to 8 weeks (through mid-February 2027), which may miss some RD deadlines
- **Connor's Action**:
  - Understand that January score release is NOT guaranteed; budget for potential late scores
  - If aiming for RD with ACT, October or earlier is safer option

## Decision Points for SAT vs ACT

**Per FR-013a**: Timeline must include decision points for evaluating SAT performance

### Initial SAT Test (Recommended: Spring Junior Year)
- **When**: May 2, 2026 (or March 14, 2026 if earlier baseline desired)
- **Registration Deadline**: April 4, 2026 (or February 10, 2026 for March test)
- **Purpose**: Establish baseline score to understand starting point; identify content gaps
- **Score Available**: ~May 16, 2026 (or ~March 28, 2026)
- **Decision Point After Scores**:
  - Are scores within 100 points of target for Connor's universities? → Continue with SAT prep
  - Are scores significantly below target? → Plan intensive summer review

### Second SAT Test (Recommended: Summer/Early Fall Senior Year)
- **When**: August 15, 2026 or September 12, 2026 (allow 8-12 weeks prep time from May test)
- **Registration Deadline**: July 18, 2026 (August test) or August 15, 2026 (September test)
- **Purpose**: Improve on baseline score with targeted preparation over summer
- **Score Available**: ~August 29, 2026 (August test) or ~September 26, 2026 (September test)
- **CRITICAL DECISION POINT After These Scores**:
  - **Scenario A - Scores Competitive**: Scores within Connor's target range (typically 1200-1400 for target universities)
    - Action: Continue with SAT; register for October 3, 2026 final SAT attempt
    - Timeline: Can do final polish in 2-3 weeks for October test
  - **Scenario B - Scores Below Target But Improving**: Showing 50-100+ point improvement from baseline
    - Action: Evaluate whether to continue SAT or switch to ACT; must decide by early September
    - Timeline: If switching to ACT, register for September or October 2026 ACT
  - **Scenario C - Scores Significantly Below Target/Plateau**: Minimal improvement from May test
    - Action: Switch to ACT immediately; this is the pivot point
    - Timeline: Register for September 2026 ACT (or October if more time needed)

### Switch to ACT Deadline
- **Latest Date to Switch**: September 5, 2026 (to register for October ACT before EA/ED deadline; see note below)
- **Practical Deadline for October Test**: Early September 2026 (registration ~August 25-28, 2026)
- **Why**: After September 12 SAT scores released (~September 26), Connor has only 9 days to decide, register for ACT, and prepare - insufficient time
- **Earlier Switch Option**: August 15, 2026 (switch after August SAT scores, register for September ACT)
- **Action if Switching**:
  - If SAT scores in August aren't competitive, immediately register for September 2026 ACT
  - Begin or intensify ACT-specific preparation (different question types, pacing, science section)
  - Allow 4-6 weeks focused ACT prep before September test

## Important Notes & Considerations

### Test-Optional Policies
**Note**: Test-optional policies continue to evolve. These should be verified 1-2 months before application submission for each institution.

- **NC State**: Generally test-optional; SAT/ACT not required but scores considered if submitted
- **Duke**: Requires SAT/ACT (test-required); strong scores important for competitive admissions
- **UCLA**: Test-blind California public university (cannot use test scores in admissions)
- **App State**: Generally test-optional; SAT/ACT not required but scores considered if submitted
- **NC A&T**: Generally test-optional; SAT/ACT not required but scores considered if submitted

- **UNC Charlotte**: Generally test-optional; SAT/ACT not required but scores considered if submitted
- **UNC Chapel Hill**: Requires SAT/ACT (test-required); strong scores important for competitive admissions

**Decision for Connor**:
- For UCLA: Testing not required or used; focus on other application components
- For Duke, Georgia Tech, UNC Chapel Hill: Strong test scores are important for competitive admissions
- For others: Taking SAT/ACT and achieving strong scores will strengthen application, especially valuable for homeschooler validation
- **Recommendation**: Pursue testing regardless; strong scores never hurt and can differentiate Connor's homeschool credentials

### Score Sending

  - Can send more for $12 per report
  - Reports sent directly from College Board to colleges
  - Can designate colleges at time of registration or within 9 days of test

  - **ACT**: Score Choice available; Connor can send individual test dates or all tests
  - **Per-test policies**: Check with individual universities for any restrictions on Score Choice

- **Superscoring**:
  - **SAT**: Most universities superscore SAT (combine highest section scores across multiple tests)
  - **ACT**: Some universities superscore ACT; others use best composite score only
  - **Check with each school**: Always verify superscoring policy at each of Connor's target universities

### Accommodations
- **Special Accommodations**: If Connor needs testing accommodations (extended time, reader, etc.), research process must begin early
