## Important Notes

### Financial Need vs. Merit-Based
Many scholarships listed as "merit-based" still consider financial need as a factor:
- **Pure Merit:** National Merit, AIAA, Coca-Cola, Ron Brown, YoungArts, Scholastic Art & Writing
- **Merit + Some Need:** Elks MVS, Horatio Alger, Burger King Scholars
- **Need-Based (Excluded):** Gates Scholarship, Jack Kent Cooke, Dell Scholars, QuestBridge

### Application Strategy
1. **Start Early:** Many deadlines are in fall of senior year
2. **Membership Requirements:** Some require AIAA, NSHSS, or other memberships - join early
3. **Essays:** Begin drafting personal statements and essays summer before senior year
4. **Letters of Recommendation:** Request from teachers/mentors well in advance
5. **Portfolio Development:** For arts/design/architecture scholarships, curate strong portfolio
6. **Research Projects:** For STEM competitions, begin research projects early (ideally junior year or before)
7. **Test Preparation:** PSAT (for National Merit) and SAT/ACT scores matter for many scholarships

### Homeschool Considerations
- Ensure transcript is well-documented with course descriptions and grades
- Strong SAT/ACT scores particularly important for homeschooled students
- Document extracurriculars, community service, and leadership thoroughly
- Some scholarships may require additional documentation for homeschool students

### North Carolina Advantages
- Priority NC State and UNC system scholarships (residency advantage)
- Apply by November 1 early action deadline for best merit consideration
