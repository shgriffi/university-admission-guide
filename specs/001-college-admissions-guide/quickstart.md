## How to Use the Spreadsheet

### Tab Overview

**Master Timeline Tab** (Your Daily/Weekly Reference):
- Shows ALL deadlines in chronological order
- Use this for: Daily/weekly deadline checks, overall progress tracking
- Color coding: Red = overdue, Yellow = upcoming, Green = completed
- **Start here every time you open the spreadsheet**

**University Tabs** (8 tabs, one per school):
- Shows all deadlines for ONE specific university
- Use this for: Working on specific applications, tracking university-specific requirements
- Example: When applying to Duke, open the "Duke" tab to see all Duke-related deadlines

**Career Tabs** (7 tabs, one per career):
- Shows which universities offer programs for ONE career path
- Use this for: Comparing program options, understanding program deadlines by career interest
- Example: If interested in Aerospace Engineering, open "Aerospace Engineering" tab to see which schools offer it

### Daily/Weekly Workflow

**Every Morning** (During Application Season):
1. Open spreadsheet → Master Timeline tab
2. Check "Days Until" column for anything upcoming in next 7 days
3. Look for red (overdue) items - handle immediately
4. Review yellow (upcoming) items - plan to complete soon

**Every Week**:
1. Review next 30 days in Master Timeline
2. Update Status for any completed tasks (mark as "Completed")
3. Check university tabs for detailed requirements on upcoming applications
4. Add any newly discovered deadlines

**Every Month**:
1. Review the full next month in Master Timeline
2. Cross-reference with guide document timeline section
3. Verify critical deadlines haven't changed (check official university websites)
4. Plan campus visits using Visit Planning section of guide

### Updating the Spreadsheet

**Marking Tasks Complete**:
1. Find the task in the appropriate tab
2. Change Status dropdown from "Not Started" to "Completed"
3. Task will turn gray with strikethrough (automatic formatting)
4. Update the same task in Master Timeline if it's there

**Adding New Deadlines**:
1. Go to the appropriate tab (university or career)
2. Insert a new row
3. Fill in all columns: Date, Task, Category, Priority, etc.
4. Also add to Master Timeline for visibility
5. The row will auto-format based on conditional formatting rules

**Changing Priorities**:
1. If a deadline becomes more urgent, change Priority to "Critical"
2. Text will turn bold red automatically
3. Task will sort higher in priority when you refresh the sort

### Filtering and Sorting

**Quick Filters**:
- Click the filter button (▼) in any column header
- Select specific values to show only those rows
- Example: Filter Master Timeline by "University/Scope" = "Duke" to see only Duke deadlines

**Useful Filter Views**:
- This Month: Filter by Date within 30 days + Status ≠ Completed
- Critical Only: Filter by Priority = Critical
- By Category: Filter by Category (e.g., only Testing tasks)

**Sorting**:
- Click any column header to sort by that column
- Master Timeline is pre-sorted by Date (soonest first)
- University tabs are pre-sorted by Date
- Career tabs are pre-sorted by Application Deadline

### Tips and Tricks

**Find Deadlines Fast**:
- Use Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on Mac) to search for specific universities or keywords
- Master Timeline has everything - use this for comprehensive searches
- University tabs are best for focused work on one school

**Track Progress**:
- Look at the summary statistics at the top of Master Timeline
- Shows: Total tasks, Completed count, Overdue count, Next deadline
- Gives you a quick progress snapshot

**Avoid Mistakes**:
- Don't delete rows with deadlines - mark them "Not Applicable" instead
- Don't change column headers or formulas (unless you know Excel well)
- Save a backup copy before making major changes
- Use "Undo" (Ctrl+Z) if you accidentally delete something

**Color Meanings**:
- Red background = OVERDUE (act immediately!)
- Yellow background = Upcoming within 2 weeks (plan to complete)
- Green background = Completed (well done!)
- Gray text = Completed or not applicable (can ignore)

## Organizing Your Work

### By Timeline (Chronological Approach)
1. Use Master Timeline tab as your primary reference
2. Work through deadlines in date order
3. Best for: Staying on top of what's due next

### By University (School-Focused Approach)
1. Pick your top choice university
2. Use that university's tab to see all requirements
3. Complete everything for that school before moving to next
4. Best for: Deep focus on specific applications

### By Career (Interest-Driven Approach)
1. Start with career tabs to understand program availability
2. Narrow down university choices based on program strength
3. Then use university tabs to complete applications
4. Best for: Still exploring career options, want to understand programs first

**Recommendation for Connor**: Start with Career approach (February-April 2026), switch to Timeline approach during application season (August 2026-January 2027).

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't find a specific deadline"
- Check Master Timeline tab (has everything)
- Use search function (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F)

### "The colors aren't showing up"
- Conditional formatting may not have copied
- In Excel: Home → Conditional Formatting → check if rules exist
- In Google Sheets: Format → Conditional Formatting → check if rules exist

### "I accidentally deleted important data"
- Use Undo (Ctrl+Z or Cmd+Z) immediately
- If file is saved, restore from backup copy
- Re-enter data from guide document if needed

### "Dates are showing as numbers"
- Column is formatted as Number instead of Date
- Fix: Select column → Format Cells → Date → MM/DD/YYYY
