# Connor - College Admissions Guide Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accessibility

All content MUST be clear, jargon-free, and understandable to parents and students of all backgrounds
and education levels.

**Requirements**:
- Plain language for all explanations - avoid admissions jargon or define terms when first used
- Reading level MUST NOT exceed 10th grade (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level ≤ 10.0)
- Complex processes MUST be broken into simple, numbered steps
- Visual aids (flowcharts, timelines, checklists) MUST accompany complex topics
- Multi-language support considerations documented for future expansion

**Rationale**: The college admissions process is already overwhelming. Our guide succeeds only if
families can understand and act on the information without requiring prior admissions expertise or
advanced education degrees.

### II. Accuracy

All admissions information, deadlines, requirements, and processes MUST be current, factually
correct, and cite authoritative sources.

**Requirements**:
- Every statement of fact MUST cite an authoritative source (college websites, Common App, College
  Board, FAFSA, etc.)
- Deadlines and requirements MUST include verification dates (e.g., "as of January 2026")
- Changes to admissions policies MUST be tracked and updated within 30 days of announcement
- All examples MUST use realistic data or clearly mark fictional scenarios
- Conflicting information across sources MUST be noted and explained

**Rationale**: Inaccurate admissions information can have devastating consequences for families -
missed deadlines, incorrect applications, or poor financial decisions. Trust is paramount and
requires rigorous fact-checking.

### III. Comprehensiveness

Content MUST cover the complete admissions journey from freshman year planning through enrollment,
including academics, testing, applications, financial aid, and decision-making.

**Requirements**:
- Timeline MUST span all four years of high school (grades 9-12) plus summer before college
- Topics MUST include: course selection, GPA, standardized testing, extracurriculars, application
  strategy, essays, recommendations, financial aid, scholarships, college visits, decision factors,
  and enrollment
- Each topic MUST address: what it is, why it matters, when to do it, and how to do it
- Coverage MUST include both traditional and alternative paths (community college, gap year,
  transfer, etc.)
- Gaps or "beyond scope" items MUST be explicitly documented with external resources provided

**Rationale**: Incomplete guidance leaves families vulnerable to missing critical steps. A
comprehensive approach ensures no family is disadvantaged by not knowing what they don't know.

### IV. Actionability

Content MUST provide concrete steps, checklists, timelines, and practical tools that families can
immediately use.

**Requirements**:
- Every major topic MUST include actionable next steps or a checklist
- Grade-by-grade timelines MUST specify month-by-month activities
- Templates MUST be provided for: college lists, application trackers, financial aid comparison,
  decision matrices
- Processes MUST be described as numbered step-by-step procedures
- Abstract advice ("build relationships with teachers") MUST be paired with concrete tactics
  ("email teachers in September to discuss junior year goals")

**Rationale**: Families need more than information - they need a roadmap they can follow. Action
items transform knowledge into progress and reduce the paralysis that comes from information
overload.

### V. Inclusivity

Content MUST address diverse student situations including varying financial circumstances, academic
profiles, first-generation students, and special circumstances.

**Requirements**:
- Financial guidance MUST cover full spectrum: need-based aid, merit aid, no aid, full-pay, and
  affordability concerns
- Academic paths MUST address high achievers, average students, late bloomers, and learning
  differences
- First-generation student challenges MUST be explicitly acknowledged with targeted support
- Special circumstances MUST be covered: military families, foster youth, undocumented students,
  students with disabilities, non-traditional students
- Language MUST avoid assumptions about family resources, background knowledge, or support systems

**Rationale**: The college admissions process advantages those with resources and insider knowledge.
Our guide levels the playing field by ensuring all families see themselves represented and supported,
regardless of background.

## Content Standards

All content creation and updates MUST adhere to these structural and formatting requirements:

- **Organization**: Content MUST follow the chronological journey (grade 9 → enrollment) with clear
  navigation to topic-based deep dives
- **Formatting**: Use consistent heading hierarchy, bullet points for lists, numbered steps for
  processes, tables for comparisons
- **Length**: Individual sections MUST be digestible (500-2000 words); longer topics split into
  subsections
- **Examples**: Every abstract concept MUST include at least one concrete, realistic example
- **Cross-references**: Related topics MUST link to each other bidirectionally
- **Updates**: Metadata MUST track last update date, next review date, and source verification dates

## Verification & Quality Assurance

Content accuracy and currency MUST be continuously validated through these procedures:

- **Source Verification**: All cited sources MUST be checked quarterly (Sept, Dec, March, June) for
  updates
- **Review Cycle**: Full content review MUST occur annually each summer (June-August) before new
  admission cycles
- **Expert Review**: At minimum annually, content MUST be reviewed by current admissions
  professionals or counselors
- **User Testing**: Content MUST be tested with target audience (parents and students) before
  publication and after major updates
- **Error Correction**: Factual errors MUST be corrected within 48 hours of discovery; affected
  families notified if applicable
- **Change Log**: All substantive content changes MUST be documented with date, reason, and impact
  assessment

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other project practices and content decisions. The five Core
Principles are non-negotiable - all content, features, and decisions MUST align with these
principles.

**Amendment Procedure**:
- Amendments MUST be proposed in writing with rationale and impact assessment
- Proposed amendments MUST include migration plan for affected content
- Amendments require documented approval before implementation
- Version numbering MUST follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)

**Compliance Review**:
- All new content MUST be reviewed for constitutional compliance before publication
- All content updates MUST verify continued alignment with principles
- Violations MUST be documented and justified or corrected within one review cycle

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-13 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-13
